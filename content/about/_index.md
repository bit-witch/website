Project Löwenware started its life in year 2014, when its founder Ilja Kartashov
decided to create a tool for high-performance web applications development. That
was a multithread synchronnous solution called WebStuff those days. Active
development process has turned it into completely new tool named [AISL](/aisl/).
Commercial interest to this solution allowed to establish Löwenware company in
Czech Republic in 2017.

## Performance does matter

We live in the era of high-end computers that can provide incredible user
experience solving our daily tasks. Unfortunately mainstream development tools
are focused more on making programmer's life easier, than on product performance
. At the same time we have older technologies optimized for much less efficient
hardware. They require higher skill, more time and efforts, providing you as a
developer full control over hardware, making possible to keep things simple and 
in the end to build fast and usable application. With no doubt, we prefer just 
such technologies.

While avoiding usage of some fasionable tools, keeping simplicity and some kind
of minimalism in our projects, we are not conservators, neither nerds. We are
quite open to shiny wowing stuff, but we just think it must be reached in a bit
other way.

## Openness

By opening source codes we allow other developers to contribute to our projects
and at the same time we contribute to work of other people who may use some of
our workouts and ideas. Such collaboration between developers all over the world
pushes technology progress forward and we like it.

At the same time we are open for commercial projects and investing incomes into
our open solutions development and support.

## Creativity

We are working on many interesting projects and not all of them are applications
or libraries. In 2018 we've lanuched production of [Dotrix](/dotrix/) books that
we wanted to use in our team and actually we use them a lot nowadays. We like 
them that much that we decided to spread them over other designers and engineers.

In 2019 we've started our experiments with video processing, sound recording
and OpenGL development that will turn into new projects and new content in some
nearest future.
